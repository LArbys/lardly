# Installation instructions

Follow [this page](https://dash.plot.ly/installation) to install `plotly dash`.

You also need to build the `ubdl` version of the DL LEE software. (`dllee_unified` might work in principle).

The `ubdl` [repo](https://github.com/larbys/ubdl).

The `dllee_unified` [repo](https://github.com/larbys/dllee_unified).
